            There have been many transitions in my life so far and it's still ongoing! I lived in Korea and came to Seattle in 2016. I majored in Communication in college and have read many people's thoughts. I was an Administrative assistant for a mobile company and I was motivated to enter an IT field. I am currently embarking on a software engineering career. I always try my best to experience and learn new things every moment and every place I am in.
